Make sure the port for your app is 8080, the default!!

Extra Credit (10pts): Google how to create an admin page for your site. Add to it ways to enter your skills, projects, and education via this interface.

Extra Credit (5pts): A really nice looking interface. -3pts for a really ugly one. 

10pts: Create this site on your own machine and push all appropriate code to your Github.

10pts: Create a Digital Ocean droplet and deploy your app to it.

Submit here your Github repository link and your IP address for your Digital Ocean website. If you did create an admin page, submit your IP address or a link to it here as well (no credit for it if you don't).
